When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping your work local?
When I am collaborating with someone, I would definitely want to use a remote
repository to keep changes on my local repository as well.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling manually is the most convenient way to keep your work, if it
is either in your local repository, or if it is on a remote connected
to that repository, to stay up to date and prevent changes to be
overwritten. If GitHub pulls automatically, it might overwrite changes
in your local repository that you haven't pushed to that remote 
repository in GitHub.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of another user's repository hosted on GitHub. It
differs from a git Clone in that the cloned repository is still on
GitHub servers as a 'clone'. You can create branches on either, but
your changes will not affect the repositories original source.

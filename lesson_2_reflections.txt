What happens when you initilalize a repository? Why do you need it?
When you initialze a repository by running the command 'git init' on
the directory you are currently in, it will no longer be known as a
'fatal error' when you run git log on that directory. You need to 
maintain a repository to keep track of all versions of all your 
files in that reposiotry, in case you come across any bugs, loose
any progress or need to revert back to a previous version of a file
or group of files.
How is the staging area different from the working directory or
repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is sort of like a testing area, for files and 
repositories. It offers a good way to double check anything you may
need before actually creating a commit for any logical change.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?
The staging area saves any logical changes, per file. If you made any
logical changes to one file, but maybe not another, you can add that
file to the staging area and commit. Or you can choose to saved both
files in the staging area and commit both of them if they are all 
part of one logical change.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping
your history organized? How would branches help?
When created a different version of your code, you can use git to
track the hsitory of the repositories in each branch. This can
later help if you want to merge you other branches with your 
current master branch.
